f"""You are an expert in meteorology and fire disaster analysis and are analyzing fire disaster events in real time in order to provide very detailed analysis on the event and all the different factors and facets of how it will play out realistically.

        Your task is to provide a comprehensive, real-time analysis of a fire disaster event using the data provided. Your analysis should include detailed insights, accurate predictions, intelligent observations, and actionable recommendations to mitigate the impact of the disaster.

        The data that is given contains all the data known for the fire disaster events and the current climate/weather conditions in the region that the fire disaster is occurring in right now, which gives all the information needed to accurately interpret the scenario, make intuitive forecasts, and give precise, logical foresight into the unknown, future result of the event. 

        Here is the data for the Fire disaster event you need to analyze:

        <event_title> Title: {details['title']} </event_title> [Insert title of fire disaster event]  
        <event_description> Description:{details['description']} </event_description>[Insert detailed description of the fire event] 
        <disaster_type> Disaster Type: {details['category']} </disaster_type> [eg: Wildfire/Urban fire/Industrial fire/etc]

        <disaster_details> Disaster Details: {metadata.__str__()} </disaster_details>[Rate of spread, current perimeter size, area burned, direction of spread, etc.  ]
        <climate_data> Climate Data: {weather.__str__()} </climate_data>
        <Historical_data>Historical Data:{details[‘similar_fire_events’]}</Historical_data>

        Using this information, conduct a thorough analysis of the event. Follow these steps:

Extract and list key data points from each input section.
Summarize the key details of the event focusing on fire-specific metrics and weather influence.   
Analyze the current situation, potential progression of the fire, integrating factors such as terrain, fuel type, and weather.
Predict future behavior, considering spread rates, containment probability, and duration.
Assess immediate impacts on urban areas, wildlife, and critical infrastructure.     
Provide mitigation strategies focusing on evacuation plans, containment methods, and long-term recovery.
 Offer safety recommendations tailored to the region and severity of the event.
Quantify uncertainty levels and confidence metrics for predictions.
 Consider historical patterns and similar past events.
 Estimate the severity of the event using historical patterns and current data.
 Integrate weather context and its influence on the event's behavior.
Evaluate the reliability and completeness of the provided data.
Provide historical comparisons to similar past events and past events in the same region.
Offer localized recommendations, resources, and all other ciritcal observations that are important to the most realistic outcome.
                
        Before providing your final analysis, break down your thought process inside <disaster_analysis> tags to ensure you've
        covered all necessary aspects. This will help you generate a comprehensive and well-structured response. It's OK for
        this section to be quite long.

        Your final output should be structured as follows:

        <event_summary>
        [Provide a summary of the event, including type, location, and current status]
        </event_summary>

        <detailed_analysis>
        [Present your in-depth analysis of the event, including current situation and potential progression and accounting for similar past events and past events in the same region]
        </detailed_analysis>

        <predictions>
        [Offer predictions about the event's trajectory, severity, expected duration, and other important features specific to the event]
        </predictions>

        </mitigation_strategies>

        <recommendations>
        [Provide actionable safety recommendations and list relevant resources]
        </recommendations>

        Ensure your response is clear, detailed, and provides intelligent information that goes beyond what can be directly
        inferred from the given data. Your analysis should aim to help decision-makers take appropriate actions to manage the
        disaster effectively in order to mitigate the urban and environmental impact in predicted regions and regions that
        could possibly be affected as well.

These events led to the evacuation of over 180,000 residents, destruction of approximately 17,000 structures, and at least 29 fatalities. The fires, fueled by extreme drought and strong Santa Ana winds, are among the most destructive in the state's history.\n</event_summary>\n\n<detailed_analysis>\nThe wildfires ignited under conditions of prolonged drought and were exacerbated by powerful Santa Ana winds, which caused rapid fire spread and the development of spot fires far from the main fire fronts. The urban-wildland interface areas were particularly vulnerable, leading to significant property loss and displacement. Emergency response efforts were challenged by the scale and speed of the fires, necessitating federal assistance and interstate resource mobilization.\n</detailed_analysis>\n\n<predictions>\nPost-fire risks include increased susceptibility to mudslides and flooding in burn areas, especially during the rainy season. Long-term recovery will require substantial investment in infrastructure rebuilding, housing, and community support services. Climate models predict a continued trend of increasing wildfire frequency and intensity in the region.\n</predictions>\n\n<impacts>\nThe wildfires caused extensive damage to residential areas, critical infrastructure, and natural ecosystems. Power outages affected over 1.5 million individuals, and air quality deteriorated to hazardous levels. The economic impact is substantial, with estimates reaching up to $275 billion in losses.\n</impacts>\n\n<mitigation_strategies>\n- Enforce stricter building codes and land-use regulations in fire-prone areas.\n- Invest in early detection and rapid response systems.\n- Conduct regular controlled burns and vegetation management to reduce fuel loads.\n- Enhance community education and preparedness programs.\n</mitigation_strategies>\n\n<recommendations>\n- Residents in high-risk areas should develop and maintain evacuation plans.\n- Authorities should prioritize the restoration of essential services and infrastructure.\n- Policymakers must address climate change impacts and invest in long-term resilience strategies.\n- Collaboration between federal, state, and local agencies is essential for effective disaster response and recovery.\n</recommendations>
